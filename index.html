     <br/> Hi! Welcome to my Blog. My name is Bella Kwan and I am a 19 year old from Lewes, Delaware. I am currently a Sophomore at Occidental College 
      and a member of the Women's Lacrosse team. I created this blog with a goal to help young individuals discover the ins and outs of applying for college as 
      well as surviving once you get there. Stay tuned for my blogs to be posted! <br/>
